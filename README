Instructions for building Dot-Examples

1. Import dot-examples
$ mbed import http://os.mbed.com/teams/MultiTech/code/Dot-Examples/

2. cd to the Dot-Examples/examples and import the dot library stack
Choose either the stable or dev library for your dot device
e.g. to get the latest development library for the xDot
$ mbed add http://os.mbed.com/teams/MultiTech/code/libxDot-dev-mbed5/

3. Update mbed-os revision to match that of the dot library you just imported.
This information can be found in the library's commit history.
e.g.
$ cd Dot-Examples/mbed-os
$ mbed update mbed-os-5.7.6

4. Modify the Dot-Examples/examples/example_config.h to select the channel plan and which example to build
By default, the OTA example is selected to build with the US channel plan

5. Once the example is selected, modify the example source file to match the configuration of your gateway.
Make sure the network_name, network_passphrase, frequency_sub_band (US), public_network, and join_delay settings match that of your gateway
